# TO DO LIST

In this project, I created a dynamic to-do list witch items can be added, deleted and moved. The tasks are saved in the localStorage and can be seen in the same way in a new visit to the page.

_This project was developed based on [Frontend Mentor's challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW)_
